Hey ! This code is meant to be used when organizing tournament in Super Animal Royale (Solo as well as duo and squads !)
it needs a Python IDE to work, the Numpy, Tkinter and the Matplotlib libraries, so you may need to search how to install those

If you want to try the code, I've put some round on the repo so you can experiment

WinPython might be a great choice for begginers : https://github.com/winpython/winpython/releases/tag/6.1.20230518final


You can also install python and pip  : https://youtu.be/ys9DesZ0SpE?si=PFAtimI_vToU7JVJ
And than install matplotlib by typing the following command in the cmd :
python -m pip install -U pip
python -m pip install -U matplotlib


If you need help, feel free to contact me on Discord (@moutonbinoclard)

The rest of the instruction are directly in the python file, Enjoy !
