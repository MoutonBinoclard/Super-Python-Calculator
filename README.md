Hey ! This code is meant to be used when organizing tournament in Super Animal Royale (Solo as well as duo and squads !)
it needs a Python IDE to work and the Numpy and the Matplotlib libraries, so you may need to search how to install those
(WinPython might be a great choice for begginers : https://github.com/winpython/winpython/releases/tag/6.1.20230518final)

If you need help, feel free to contact me on Discord (@moutonbinoclard)

The rest of the instruction are directly in the python file, Enjoy !
